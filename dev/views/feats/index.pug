      p A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise.
      p You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can’t benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

          h2 Alert
          p Always on the lookout for danger, you gain the following benefits:
          ul
            li You gain a -3 bonus to initiative.
            li You can’t be surprised while you are conscious.
            li Other creatures don’t gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being hidden from you.
        .feat
          h2 Athlete
          p You have undergone extensive physical training to gain the following benefits:
          ul
            li Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20. When you are prone, standing up uses only 2 meter of your movement. Climbing doesn’t halve your speed. You can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 2 meter on foot, rather than 3 meter.
        .feat
          h2 Actor
          p Skilled at mimicry and dramatics, you gain the following benefits:
          ul
            li Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
            li •	You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person.
            li •	You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.
        .feat
          h2 Charger
          p When you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature.
        .feat
          h2 Crossbow Expert
          p Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:
          ul
            li •	You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.
            li•	Being within 3 meter of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
            li•	When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded hand crossbow you are holding.
        .feat
          h2 Defensive Duelist
          p
            em Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher              
          p When you are wielding a finesse weapon with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.
