          h3 In #[span] the #[span] cloud
          h4 Custom saying
          p An item can be in the cloud if the item in question is not on a person by definitation, but rather accesible at any time by the group. This is to avoid certain story items to be lost if a certain player isn't present. This way, the party has everything that they need at any time. This rule doesn't apply to common items and can only be used in a neutral way. They party can't share potions this way for instance.

          h3 Exp #[span] and #[span] leveling
          h4 Custom rule
          p Earning exp is not limited to just combat. The party earns experience via combat, social interactions and trevelaing parts of the story. Progression is rewarded, even if combat is avoided. This is to reward out of the box thinking when met with a difficult situation. Custom lvl'ing caps are also in place:

          h3 Abscence #[span] from #[span] game
          h4 General rule
          p If you can't be present during a session, your character will sit out one session. This means that they will not gain any experience. However, they might experience a custom story line or extra plot, aside the main story. This will be set up by me if the player was sick or had to cancel for a good reason. Items that your character has that are needed will count as being in the cloud however.
        li.saying
          h3 Spell #[span] amount
          h4 Custom rule
          p The amount of spells known to you is not limited or defined by an ability score. Instead, the player will learn news spells as set by their lvl'ing and stack them to a max defined by their respective tables (see handbook).
